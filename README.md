# Connecting Industrial IoT Gateway to Azure IoT Operations

An Industrial IoT solution deployed at the edge location often integrates microcontroller-based devices, sensors, and PLCs (programmable logic controllers) into industrial processes to gather data, monitor operations, and improve efficiency.  The goal is to enable real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, automation, and data-driven decision-making in industries such as manufacturing, building automation, energy, transportation, and agriculture.

IIoT gateway is a critical component in the solution to aggregate data via industry standard protocols (such as [Modbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modbus), [BACnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BACnet), [OPC UA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPC_Unified_Architecture), [Sparkplug](https://sparkplug.eclipse.org/), etc.) and send data to the cloud.

[Azure IoT Operations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-operations/overview-iot-operations) features an enterprise-grade MQTT broker that is deployed locally in an Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster running at the edge site. With proper [Data Flows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-operations/connect-to-cloud/overview-dataflow) configured, data gathered from the IIoT Gateway can be delivered to the cloud and control commands can be delivered from cloud to devices as well.

## Overview

This tutorial demonstrates a real-world scenario where a MCU-based device (an ARM Cortex-M4 basedÂ ***STM32F429ZI-Nucleo*** from [STMicroelectronics](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en.html)) publishes MQTT messages to the [EG324 IoT Gateway](https://www.elastel.com/products/iot-gateway/eg324-iot-gateway/) The IIoT Gateway, which then sends data to the AIO MQTT broker. [Zephyr](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html) is the RTOS running on the STM32 MCU device. In this tutorial, we will build a Zephyr app publishing MQTT messages upstream from the device. Finally, we will use a MQTTX client subscribing to the topic and confirm messages are delivered correctly.

Here are the MCU device and Elastel EG324 IIoT Gateway configured in this tutorial:
